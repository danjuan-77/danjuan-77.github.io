Hi, I'm Wenming Tu (涂文明). I am currently an undergraduate student at China University of Mining and Technology-Beijing, majoring in Computer Science and Technology. In September 2025, I will be joining Shanghai Jiao Tong University (SJTU) to pursue a Ph.D in Computer Science and Technology. I will be jointly supervised by Prof. [Xie Chen](https://chenxie95.github.io/) from the [X-Lance Lab](https://x-lance.sjtu.edu.cn/) and Dr. [Zilong Zheng](https://zilongzheng.github.io/) from the [Beijing Institute for General Artificial Intelligence (BIGAI)](https://www.bigai.ai/), NLCo Group. I am excited to contribute to the field of AI and continue my research on these cutting-edge technologies.

My research interests are primarily focused on **speech and audio processing**, as well as **multimodal large language models**. I aim to explore how these technologies can enhance human-computer interaction, improve speech synthesis and recognition systems, and advance the capabilities of AI in multimodal environments.

**Think bold! Work hard!**
